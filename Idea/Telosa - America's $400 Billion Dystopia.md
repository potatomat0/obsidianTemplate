Telosa - America's $400 Billion Dystopia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl5gyzezgL8

building a city in the middle of the desert is just... a dumb idea. 
- first, you can't properly and effeciently provide water without a shit ton of extra steps, since the desert is hot and you can't store or find water,
- secondly, it's power system, which is run by wind turbine, may sounds futuristic and advanced but turns out to be inefficient since it's the desert, it may cause irritating noise and producing vibrations that damage surrounding buildings. and they can't even produce electricity surplus without reservoirs 
- the third problem has to do with current sociogical problems, what exactly is this city for, since only the affluent can afford to live in this place, what about other sources of labour 
- the last problem is transportation, the city would be mainly run on cable cars, loops and helicopters, all of these are inefficient, expensive, wasteful and loud

billionaires just need to spend their money on un-glamorous but effective projects, like funding in cities that already have a lot of people, like downtowns of most american cities, fund more on housing, and re-develop some less connected areas. but nah, billionaires just want those stupid shiny bombastic gigantic futuristic ideas without having any fundamental knowledges
