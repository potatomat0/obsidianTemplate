Key take aways: 
- although his approach to philanthropy is more straight forward - giving money straight away without unnecessary leg works -  and more respectful to the experts (het lets them decide what would do with the money), so far he only donated roughly 2 percent of his net worth
- this is probably just a way of gaining positive attention from the public and easing the crititism he has had over the years for being the CEO of the most exploitative, anti-competitive and enviromentally damaging company in the world
- sure, organizations would gladly take his money, but those billions of dollars for charity pales in comparision on how much damage his company has dealt to the enviroment and the society
bezos should give away his power, not just money
