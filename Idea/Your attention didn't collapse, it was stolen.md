key take aways:
- people are losing their ability to concentrate, short attention span due to fast-pace media and entertainment is a real thing
- multi-tasking does more harm than good since human brain is essentially a single-threaded cognitive machine, doing multiple things at once means you are just juggling tasks arounds and have to waste time to switch between those tasks
- instead of multi taksing, try to engage yourself in deep work: find a meaningful thing that you want to spend your time on, try to make it a little hard but still achievable
- avoiding phones and ditching social medias isn't a long-term solutions, we need to raise more awareness to the people, pressuring companies not to deliberately snatching our attention by notifications and addictive app designs. we should make policies and law to allow people to fully spend their time on work, companies should not contact their employees outside of their work time, this may seems like a radical approach, but it sure helps in case the short-attention-span crisis explode in near future

one of the things that things that i'm actually praticing right now to improve my memory and concentration skill is to try to summarize and jot down every information that i think are useful on the internet and store them in a zettelkasten noting system, and i write in english which is not my main language, it also explains why my writing here is so dogshit but hopefully i'l get better soon
