The **Language Server Protocol** (**LSP**) is an open, [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC "JSON-RPC")-based [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") for use between [source code editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor "Source code editor") or [integrated development environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment") (IDEs) and [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") that provide [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language")-specific features like [code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete "Autocomplete"), [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting "Syntax highlighting") and marking of warnings and errors, as well as [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring "Code refactoring") routines. The goal of the protocol is to allow programming language support to be implemented and distributed independently of any given editor or IDE.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol#cite_note-1)

 Language servers or demons have been used for some time to provide semantic auto-completion support in editors like Vim and Emacs.2 Visual Studio Code provides an alternative way to implement Language Server Extension, which standardizes the communication between language tooling and code editor.3
