# Do We Really Live Under Capitalism? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGa1D_W3WaA&t=8s

This video is debunking some misconceptions 
1. about "everything that is bad and unjust in today's modern countries is not actually caused by capitalism, it's crony capitalism and corporatism"
Yes, we ARE living in a capitalist society, not crony capitalismnor corporatism
capitalism is a system where the un-elected minority has the control over the wealthy and power that can effect other people's job, choice, and well-being in order to get more profit. you either have to work for the rich guys, beat the rich guys, or starve

2. "it's just the consequences of free market"
it's no longer free market if big companies gains so much power (whether by the support of their states and policies or not) and becoming a monopoly that eats every potential rival
the goverment wouldn't try to regulate those big companies because it wouldn't benefit them in the first place
because there's no such thing as a free market in the first place

# How finland ended homelessness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbEavDqA8iE

- housing first policy: housing is the starting point, not the end point, homeless people would get permanant housing first, then they would get all the support such as medical, dental, behaviorial, job, income... later. unlike the continuum of care policies, where people has to pass some certain degree of improvements (getting rid of addictions, get a job, quit drinking, having stable mental health...) in order to get housing
-  because housing in most contries is too unafordable, in a capitalist society, housing is not considered a basic human need that should be given to the people, but instead a commodity that can be traded, but not in finland.

- there're alot of similarities between cantonese and vietnamese in terms of vocabulary, tones and grammar, since vietnam culture was mostly influence by the sinosphere. cantonese originated from guangzhou, and Vietnam (northern part) was a part of Guangdong in the past, guangdong and guangzhou are relateively close to eachother so that kind explains why
