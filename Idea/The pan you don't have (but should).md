short answer: carbon pan
why? let's talk about other types of popular pans: 
- non-stick pans: slippery, the coating is not durable, is bad for the enviroment and for our health
- stainless steel: expensive, conduct heat really fast, cools down heat fast if heat is turned down
- cast iron pan: not good at conducting heat (takes a lot more time to heat up and to cool down), the material is brittle so the pan has to be thick, it retains heat very long, which is ideal for searing food

when it comes to carbon pans, they consists of 1% of carbon steel (compared to 3% from cast iron, which yeah, the nameing is kinda confusing)

**carbon steel pan is lighter than cast iron, cheaper than stainless steel, it conducts heat fast and evenly, and when coated enough oil, it can be just as non-stick as non-stick pans**. carbon steel pans are basically the jack of all trades and master of none
