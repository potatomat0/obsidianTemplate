Body Language Pseudoscience Is Flourishing on YouTube
https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-body-language/

mutiple studies have pointed out that reading body language is not entirely possible, one subtle behavior doesn't definitively means something else, yet, youtube channels with self-proclaimed "expert", lots of them are self-taught learners, are trying to make click-baity videos, analyzing celebrities body language to "scientifically" explain why they are (insert doing things people already knew they did), it's just a form of hindsight and confirmative bias, it's harmful because people came to these videos expecting to find accurate informations. 
what's even worse is that body language reading is still quite relevent in forensic science to detect if the suspect is lying or not. multiple peoples life are in hands of pseudoscience, they are whether liberated or at worse imprisoned for the rest of their lives just because of an unreliable method

>“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” says Denault. “If someone talks about body language as a way of ‘decoding’ the mental states of others, that is a pretty extraordinary claim about nonverbal behavior. This claim would require extraordinary evidence. And there is no such evidence.”
