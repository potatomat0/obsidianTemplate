___
• In his TED Talk in July 2019, philanthropist and author Peter Singer outlined the concept of ‘effective altruism’ which refers to donations and other charitable actions, directed towards those who will experience the greatest benefit from the donation.
• While helping the most people is the goal, Singer and others in the effective altruism movement struggle to find a balance between personal and social responsibility.
• Singer and his colleagues don’t want people to take extreme measures to help others, as this can lead to greater harm if done recklessly or without regard for personal well-being.
• Despite cautioning against extreme-giving practices, Singer still believes that individuals have a moral obligation to help others and strive for the greatest good.
• According to Singer and his colleagues, the moral obligation to help is not limited to those in poverty or without access to basic needs—efforts to reduce environmental degradation, end animal abuse and ensure global health are all part of effective altruism.
• Singer and his colleagues hope to promote behaviour that both creates and sustains positive change in the world.
• Though this movement has received criticism from some, there is a growing consensus that effective altruism can be a powerful tool for making the world a better place.
