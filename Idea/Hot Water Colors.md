Hot water colors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iD1yf0mqc

another immersive and informative video from posy

- steams are just hot floating water molecules, they are the smallest "clouds"
- because they are so small, wave lengths going through those molecules will be scattered/ruptured and emitting other sources of light colors depending on the angles, this phenomenon only happens with very small particles, not with raindrops
- these particles of steamhas to be roughly the same wavelengths of the colors light. looking closely (through macro lenses) at the surface of a hot they cup, the steam molecules float on the surface of the water probably because of the tiny electromagnetic forces and stay for a long time because of the extreme humidity of the boiling water, and when a droplet of water hit the surface, it create a chain reaction, merging all the steammolecules back into the water 
alright there are much more phenomenon  information and theories explained in this 8 minute video. man, it's so genius.
