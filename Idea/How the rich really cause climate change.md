How the Rich REALLY Cause Climate Change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69DFis2WgMQ

oils company used to make ad campain asking how much carbon footprint has the interviewees produced, this is a way of individualizing and framing the cause of a bigger, more complex problems, making it look like it's the consumer who are asking for more energy and consumption, but not the provider who are harnessing and producing exsessive supplements

tracking down who has more carbon footprint isn't a good way of finding the big picture, since it's the problem of class, of the group of people who make profits out of fossil fuels. if we really want to understand a rich person's contribution to climate change, we shoundn't just look at their consumption, instead we should ask how did they get rich in the first place. 

11 members including the ceo of the Swiss-based global building materials company Holcim indirectly make up of 0.45% of the annual global carbon emission. industry is a leading GHG emitter (34%) of global emission in 2019

What rich people do at home or in their car or on their private jet pales in comparision to how much they control what the consumers can choose, to the exploitation of labour and the wrecking of the earth the generates the money they make. when we choose commodities, we can only choose those that are available and profitable to produce in the first place. under capitalism, the rich few who can choose what gets produced will ultimately decide based on how much profit they can make. 

the rich would then use the money they make to control the political game to ultimately allow them to further exploit and manipulate the industries they own. while on the other end of the spectrum, the poor will more likely to have less choice on where to live and work, and will stuck in places that are vulnerable to resource crisis and climate change. one scientific paper raise the notion that, more communal propterties will help the people more relisient they are to the fate of climate change

however, the policies maker seem to forget the fact that climate chaos is rooted in the power of the rich. in 2019, france made the decision of taxing fossil fuel, this is a mistake of looking only on the consumer side of thing, they thought that by disencouraging people from buying gas the total emission will drop, but this doens't stop the provider from producing more, profitting and causing more global problems

the solution? we need the politics of MORE, more commondity control for the masses and less power for the capitalist few. as Mark Huber wrote: 
> class politics is a powerful dot connector. it aims to tie the threads together to make clear that our movements face a common enemy - the capitalist class. And that our struggles seek common goals based on our common humanity: dignity, freedom, and a livable planet.

when we began to frame the climate crisis as the result of not how many emissions the rich emit, but instead of who controls and profit off of what fuel and what planes are being produced, then we can begin to create the lasting change
