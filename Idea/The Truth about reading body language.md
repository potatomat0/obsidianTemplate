The truth about reading body language
https://www.popsci.com/story/science/body-language-analysis/

Psychologists and other researchers agree that body language can convey certain emotional states. But many bold claims haven’t been backed by scientific evidence. For instance, claims that a single gesture reliably indicates what a person thinks or desires—that maintaining eye contact for too long means a person is lying, that a smile without crinkles around the eyes isn’t a genuine one, or that a pointed finger with a closed hand is a display of dominance.

“Our facial expressions convey certain types of emotional states,” Matsumoto says. So do some motions, like a shrug. “But there’s a lot of noise, too,” he says. “People do all kinds of things with their bodies.” For example, a person’s raised eyebrow could be express disbelief—but it might also signal discomfort or surprise. The same hand gesture could mean different things in different cultures.

Sweet cites an earlier analysis (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-11509-006/) of dozens of studies involving more than 1,300 estimates of 158 possible signs of deception. These studies focused on body language cues that people sometimes associate with lying, like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. The studies found that cues like these have either no links or only weak links to lying. No one has a giveaway like Pinocchio and his nose.
