Here, let’s remember that the Next Big Thing isn’t always so: Remember when people like me were earnestly trying to figure out what Web3 really meant, Jimmy Fallon was promoting Bored Ape NFTs, and FTX was paying millions of dollars for Super Bowl ads? That was a year ago.

Still, as the AI hype bubble inflates, I’ve been thinking a lot about the parallels with the music-versus-tech fights from more than two decades ago.

Briefly: “File-sharing” services blew up the music industry almost overnight because they gave anyone with a broadband connection the ability to download any music they wanted, for free, instead of paying $15 for a CD. The music industry responded by suing the owners of services like Napster, as well as ordinary users like a 66-year-old grandmother. Over time, the labels won their battles against Napster and its ilk, and, in some cases, their investors. They also generated tons of opprobrium from music listeners, who continued to not buy much music, and the value of music labels plummeted.

But after a decade of trying to will CD sales to come back, the music labels eventually made peace with the likes of Spotify, which offered users the ability to subscribe to all-you-can-listen-to service for a monthly fee. Those fees ended up eclipsing what the average listener would spend a year on CDs, and now music rights and the people who own them are worth a lot of money.

So you can imagine one outcome here: Eventually, groups of people who put things on the internet will collectively bargain with tech entities over the value of their data, and everyone wins. Of course, that scenario could also mean that individuals who put things on the internet discover that their individual photo or tweet or sketch means very little to an AI engine that uses billions of inputs for training.

It’s also possible that the courts — or, alternatively, regulators who are increasingly interested in taking on tech, particularly in the EU — enforce rules that make it very difficult for the likes of OpenAI to operate, and/or punish them retroactively for taking data without consent. I’ve heard some tech executives say they’d be wary of working with AI engines for fear of ending up in a suit or being required to unwind work they’d made with AI engines.

But the fact that Microsoft, which certainly knows about the dangers of punitive regulators, just plowed another $10 billion into OpenAI suggests that the tech industry figures the reward outweighs the risk. And that any legal or regulatory resolution will show up long, long after the AI winners and losers will have been sorted out.

A middle ground, for now, could be that people who know and care about this stuff take the time to tell AI engines to leave them alone. The same way people who know how webpages are made know that “robots.txt” is supposed to tell Google not to crawl your site.

Spawning.AI has built “Have I Been Trained,” a simple tool that’s supposed to tell if your artwork has been consumed by an AI engine, and gives you the ability to tell engines not to inhale it in the future. Spawning co-founder Dryhurst says the tool won’t work for everyone or every engine, but it’s a start. And, more important, it’s a placeholder as we collectively figure out what we want AI to do, and not do.

“This is a dress rehearsal and opportunity to establish habits that will prove to be crucial in the coming decades,” he told me via email. “It’s hard to say if we have two years or 10 years to get it right.”
