today’s universe. Did all their stars burn out? Have they become invisible corpses strewn — location: []() ^ref-3362

---
seething ocean of virtual particles—undetectable matter and antimatter pairs, popping — location: []() ^ref-22889

---
If you are overweight on Earth, don’t blame dark matter. — location: []() ^ref-32265

---
selfpropagating — location: []() ^ref-43084

---
And if you can stop a particle at all, you’ve detected it — location: []() ^ref-15118

universe moves under the influence of gravity. Every few years, lab scientists devise — location: []() ^ref-13073

---
all planets orbit the Sun in flattened circles called ellipses — location: []() ^ref-14423

---
every other physicist of his day had strongly presumed to be true: the status quo — location: []() ^ref-13652

---
Every second of every day, 4.5 billion tons of fast-moving hydrogen nuclei are turned into energy as they slam together to make helium within the fifteen-milliondegree core of the Sun — location: []() ^ref-7007

---
tin cans and tin foil yielded to aluminum cans and, of course, aluminum foil. ( — location: []() ^ref-28701

---
monitored for any collisions between neutrinos and gallium nuclei, turning it into germanium — location: []() ^ref-8000

---
(densest) elements on the Table—two cubic feet of it weighs as much as a Buick — location: []() ^ref-12702

---
metal in pre-measured amounts into the top of a long shaft. The blob will typically undulate — location: []() ^ref-58378

---
To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that’s hard to do, then maybe it’s easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing. To reach this density, you must compress all the empty space that atoms enjoy around their nucleus and among their orbiting electrons. Doing so will crush nearly all (negatively charged) electrons into (positively charged) protons, creating a ball of (neutrally charged) neutrons with a crazy-high surface gravity — location: []() ^ref-15043

---
high-frequency, high-energy gamma rays, with wavelengths measured in picometers.††††† — location: []() ^ref-14652

---
indicates that the Moon most likely burst forth from Earth’s iron-poor crust and mantle — location: []() ^ref-19073

---
Earth’s Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky — location: []() ^ref-42947

---
The Sun loses material from its surface at a rate of more than a million tons per second. We call this the “solar wind,” which takes the form of high-energy charged particles. Traveling up to a thousand miles per second, these particles stream through space and are deflected by planetary magnetic fields. The particles spiral down toward the north and south magnetic poles, forcing collisions with gas molecules and leaving the atmosphere aglow with colorful aurora — location: []() ^ref-20647

---
With an orbit precisely matching the rotation rate of Earth, these satellites appear to hover — location: []() ^ref-31469

---
eavesdroppers turn their own version of a radio telescope in our direction, they might infer — location: []() ^ref-58030

---
you’re wondering, when Earth passes in front of the Sun—which is always happening for some line of sight in the galaxy—we block 1/10,000th of the Sun’s surface, thereby briefly dimming the Sun’s total light by 1/10,000th of its normal brightness. Fine as it goes. They’ll discover that Earth exists, but learn nothing about happenings on Earth’s surface — location: []() ^ref-3804

learned in biology class that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of my colon — location: []() ^ref-47905
