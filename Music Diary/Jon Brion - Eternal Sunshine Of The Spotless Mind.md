## Thoughts

gosh i love this movie, the beck's song on this album is hauntingly good too. I promised to myself so many times that i'll rewatch this movie someday, i never did... actually i did once, maybe it's the soundtrack that is enough to makes me feel companied by the eerie lonliness yet at the same time heart-warming and witty and romantic and yaddi yadda argghhhh this movie is everything
