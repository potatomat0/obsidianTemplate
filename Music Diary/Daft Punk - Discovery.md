## Thoughts
A decent album, undeniable classic, I'm not really into it though, the first 5 tracks are energetic and punchy and catchy, the latter half of the album though is really finding itself into a more experimental eletronic/techno territory, the final track 'so long' is probably the most prominent example that this is not just an easy-listening with poppy catchy tunes, it's rather a sophisticated record that takes time to appreciate both in term of musicality and conceptually (nah, the lyrics are not reallt that special)
