## Thoughts

Really want to give this one a 9/10 given how deeply personal it is to me. This album has been with me through my darkest time, I still remember lying shirtless with no matress or blanket in my dorm at night last year, listening to this album and completely soak myself into this album's comforting sound to sleep. great album, might change my opinon next time i revisit
