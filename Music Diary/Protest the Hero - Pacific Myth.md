## Thoughts

this thing is a walking prog-metal cliché that has everything from guitar and drums wankery to sudden dynamic changes within songs that makes no fucking sense, regardless i do respect their huge effort into making this somehow listenable, even enjoyable, you know what, sometimes cliché are cool and needs to be embraced
