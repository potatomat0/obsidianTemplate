## Thoughts
This album is so futuristic man, not like a cyberpunk or vaporwave way, but rather mechanical and raw and unrelenting. It's like an amalgamation between Orbital and Aphex Twin (this is the most basic reference that anyone can make since I'm still not really an IDM nerd) , I'm kinda into this. tracks in this album flow really well with each other makes this as a whole a very enjoyable even in my first time listening.
